As there are a number of ways of using this endpoint, I have used an array of objects as the input. This is only
for explanatory purposes. Messages should be requested with only one of the types of payloads shown at a time.

1. Show all messages for a member
2. Show all messages for a company
3. Show all messages for a location
4. Show all messages between a location and a member
