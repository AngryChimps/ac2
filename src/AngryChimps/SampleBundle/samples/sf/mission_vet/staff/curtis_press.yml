description: |
  Curtis Press is originally from St. Louis, Missouri. He went to veterinary school in Massachusetts at Tufts University, graduating in 1995. He then completed an internship in small animal medicine and surgery at Loomis Basin Veterinary Clinic.

  His first job after completing the internship was at Mission Pet Hospital. "I have basically come to MPH to stay. Working in a constructive environment that allows me to practice very high quality medicine has always been my highest career priority."
  The working environment at MPH really facilitates camaraderie and collaboration.

  Dr. Press met his wife, Dr. Mary Press, at Tufts. They now have 5 kids; Joe, Emily, Jason, Sarah, and Fiver. As if the kids don't make the house enough of a zoo, they also have 2 dogs, 2 cats, a rabbit, a tortoise, 3 chickens, and a horse.

  Coaching (baseball, softball, basketball) and family (including the animals) have pretty much taken over all other hobbies, "although I am trying to hang on to skiing and sailing."
